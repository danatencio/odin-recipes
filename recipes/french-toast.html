            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
            <li>6 slices of bread</li>
            <li>1/2 cup maple syrup, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons whipped cream, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine half-and-half, egg whites, confectioners' sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, lemon extract, 
                and salt in a bowl; whip together with a whisk or electric whisk until well blended, about 30 seconds. 
                Pour mixture into a large, flat container.</li>
            <li>Put one bread slice in the container and flip so it is coated on both sides, almost saturated.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a frying pan over medium heat until sizzling. Add soaked bread slice to the pan; 
                you can do more than one depending on the size of the pan. Fry until medium brown and edges are crispy, 
                about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Continue cooking in batches, dipping bread and frying, and adding butter as necessary.</li>
            <li>Serve French toast with maple syrup and add whipped cream on top.</li>
        </ol>
